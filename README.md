<h1>MIDI Keyboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Using an Arduino Leonardo, I desgined a series of buttons on a large breadboard to act as keys. Then, by using MIDI communication protocol, input on the buttons is reflected by sound from MIDI compatible software such as BandLab. (BandLab is what I tested this product on because it was free and accesibile)
